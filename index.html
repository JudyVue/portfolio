        <p>This is where I talk about myself, which I don't like so right now I'm leaving it empty. I could lorem it but I am also good at typing nonsense so I can do it myself. Yeah. Talent. Here are some French words I like: fromage. Viennoiseries. Saucisson. Saint-Emilion. Ok this is mostly food and wine.</p>

      <section id="other-id">
        <p>This is where I put something else but I don't know what yet so there you go. I should probably make it a little bit longer so I can have cool long sections about interesting stuff so I should probably tell you other French words I like. La pluie. Le vent. L'automne. Riquiqui (it means really really small and I think it sounds adorable). Cool words.</p>
